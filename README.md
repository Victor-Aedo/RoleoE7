### RoleoE7

This is an application that automatically updates the tavern store of the Epic Seven mobile game and also buys mystics and covenant coins. For this it uses dependencies that allow image recognition to search for coins and mouse control to automate the process.

###  Install Dependencies

installs the dependencies from the requirements.txt file, you can use the command ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

###  Run Project

Run the main.py file using the ``` python main.py ``` command, then press the "t" key to run the project, since it has a validation to pause, resume execution, this is triggered with the "t" key and it alternates. You can stop the script permanently by pressing "esc"

### Precautions

1. Epic Seven must be run in full screen, depending on the emulator and operating system the way it is done may vary, but in most cases it is enough to press the game window and press "F11".
2. There is no guarantee that it will work for operating systems other than Windows.
3. I have not been able to verify that it works on other screen resolutions. The application was developed on a setup with a 1920 x 1080 screen, which may cause it to not work correctly on other resolutions.
